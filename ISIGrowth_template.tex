\title[Beamer customisation for the ISIGrowth project]{Beamer customisation for the ISIGrowth project}

\begin{frame}
\vspace{5ex} % adjust the vertical offset if title covers the ISIGrowth logo
\titlepage
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Premise}
This document, together with the associated package, aims at providing a \LaTeX\ implementation of the \texttt{beamer} class fully consistent with the ISIGrowth official graphic design.\\
\bigskip
Customisation is purposefully introduced in terms of \texttt{beamer} style macros, rather than as a standalone \texttt{beamer} theme, to preserve the greatest deal of flexibility on the user side.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Contents}
\tableofcontents
\end{frame}

\section{Structure and usage}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Structure and usage}
The package consists of four distinct files:
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{ISIGrowth\_template.pdf}]: \emph{this} very document
\item[\texttt{ISIGrowth\_template.tex}]: the source code of \emph{this} document
\item[\texttt{ISIGrowth\_background.png}]: the \texttt{titlepage} background image
\item[\texttt{ISIGrowth\_footer.png}]: the \texttt{footer} image
\end{description}
\bigskip
In order to adopt the proposed macros it is sufficient to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item modify the \texttt{.tex} file as needed\footnote{otherwise, copy the specific file macros (highlighted) in your own \emph{preamble}}
\item enclose the two \texttt{.png} files within the same directory
\item compile with your preferred \LaTeX\ engine
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\section{Compatibility}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Compatibility}
The provided macros do \emph{not} constitute a theme and are neither theme-specific, nor style-specific, beyond what is hereby defined.\\
\bigskip 
In principle, they should be compatible with all the built-in \texttt{beamer} themes, as long as the theme is called \underline{\emph{before}} the macros are defined in the underlying \texttt{.tex} file preamble.\\
\bigskip
Feel free to choose your favourite \texttt{beamer} theme\footnote{The \texttt{default} theme is used in \emph{this} very presentation} but make sure the code complies with the aforementioned ordering.
\end{frame}

\section{Title page}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Title page}
The \texttt{titlepage} is defined as a \texttt{plain}-style frame with a locally defined background image covering the whole available space.\\
\bigskip
If necessary, adjust the \verb|\vspace{}| offset before calling \verb|\maketitle| or or \verb|\titlepage| in order to prevent the writings from covering the ISIGrowth logo.\\
\bigskip
CAUTION! Since the original background image is in 4:3 aspect ratio, any layout different from 4:3 is incompatible with the proposed macros.
\end{frame}

\section{Frame footer}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Frame footer}
Every frame other than the \texttt{titlepage} contains a bottom footer.\\
\bigskip
The footer consists of an image bar and two dynamic containers:
\begin{itemize}
\item the first only shows the \texttt{shorttitle} variable\
\item the second encloses the \texttt{shortauthor} and the \texttt{shortdate} variables, and a \texttt{n/N} frame counter
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
CAUTION! Had the frame body been longer than available space, the exceeding part would just disappear behind the footer.
\end{frame}
