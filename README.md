# beamer-template-ISIGrowth

This repository provides a `LaTeX` template for the `beamer` 'documentclass' adequately consistent with the **ISIGrowth** official graphical design.

Customisation is purposefully introduced in terms of style *macros*, rather than as a standalone *theme* to preserve the
greatest deal of flexibility on the user side.

## Usage
 1. modify the provided `ISIGrowth_template.tex` file as needed (or alternatively, copy the specific file macros (highlighted) into your own *preamble*)
 2. enclose the following files within the same directory
  >* `ISIGrowth_background.png`
  >* `ISIGrowth_footer.png`
 3. compile with your favourite `LaTeX` engine.
